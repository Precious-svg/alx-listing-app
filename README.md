# ALX Listing App

## Project Description

The **ALX Listing App** is a web application designed to create a listing page for properties, similar to the popular platform Airbnb. The goal of this project is to provide a clean and scalable design for property listings, allowing users to view details of available properties, and perform actions like booking or viewing more information.

This app leverages reusable components, such as cards and buttons, and organizes the project structure for scalability and maintainability. The app features a responsive layout, clean code architecture, and a user-friendly interface.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into several directories to separate concerns and promote modularity. Here's a brief overview of the structure:

- **`components/`**: This directory contains reusable React components that are used across the app. For example:
  - **`/common/Card.tsx`**: A reusable component to display property information in a card format.
  - **`/common/Button.tsx`**: A reusable button component for user actions (e.g., "Book Now", "Details").

- **`interfaces/`**: This directory defines TypeScript interfaces for the props of the components. These interfaces are used to provide type safety throughout the app. For instance:
  - **`index.ts`**: Contains the `CardProps` and `ButtonProps` interfaces that define the shape of props passed to the `Card` and `Button` components.

- **`constants/`**: This directory holds constants that are used across the application. Examples include API URLs, configuration settings, and UI text. For example:
  - **`index.ts`**: Contains constants such as the API URL and UI text strings like "Book Now" and "View Details".

- **`public/assets/`**: This directory contains static files such as images, icons, or other assets that the application needs. These files are publicly accessible and used throughout the app.
